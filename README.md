# Low Rank and Sparse Decomposition

## Introduction
This package decomposes given movie data into a background (low rank) matrix and a foreground (sparse) matrix.
This includes Xu et.al's method[^Xu] and my improved method.

## Note
This package is based on my master's study at Graduate School of Infomatics, Kyoto University.
Originally I coded it on Matlab, and this is the rewritten version for Python 2.X.
The following result is obtained by the original Matlab version.
